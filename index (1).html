      <h4><kbd>Turkey, Istanbul</kbd></h4>
      <hr  >
      <h5 class="text-success"> I visited in February 2022</h5>
      <p class="text-muted">Turkey, Istanbul is a wonderful place to go. The busy areas with shop and food everywhere you go and wonderul scene at night. The spice market is full of wonderful Turkish traditional item to buy. The blue mosque was amazing and its stained glass windows and its intricate designs were beautiful and colorful.The whole city is so exciting and magical. The people are lovely, so kind and friendly. The sights are much to beholden. I have been many times, and I still find new and interesting places to go to.
        I will never get tired of this place. The shopping is brilliant, the main shopping street the Turkish people go to is the best. So many different things to see and buy. The only downside is the scams.</p>

  <p>The Mitchells vs the Machines is a ridiculously fun and thought-provoking satire on how humanity has become over-reliant on technology, so much so that a simple dinner conversation with your family has become a rare occurrence.Incredible! I like this more then Spider-Verse in my opinion. The animation is very artsy in a different way then Spider-Verse, also brought by Lord and Miller, the filmakers, in a different way that I like and that is quite appealing to me. And Spider-Verse is no bad film obviously, but this just seems to be Lord and Millers best animated film since what may be their best film, The Lego Batman Movie. This film shows how a family can come together during a situation in such beautiful ways, and gives interesting thought on the modern world. Some comedy is cute and clever here and there are crazy hidden references I did not know about till I watched the Cinemawins video. The action is so stylish too, that great blend of animation and action that comes in certain animated films... Seems to come well in Lord and Miller's films. The Mitchell's Vs. The Machines is so far the best animated film of 2021 I saw out of the 2 I saw so far, the other being the cute and colorful Luca.</p>
